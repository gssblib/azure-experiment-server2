# Script for uploading families from a CSV file to the borrowers table.
#
# In the end, it was easier to implement this script in node and add the
# new borrowers by calling the function in the library module used by the
# server. This function generates the borrower ids, for example, and thus
# makes sure that the new borrower is consistent with borrowers added in
# the UI. However, the parsing and transformation is simpler is this
# Python implementation.
